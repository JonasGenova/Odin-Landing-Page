# Odin-Landing-Page

This is my second project for The Odin Project, titled Odin Landing Page. The task is to build a website using both HTML and CSS. While the course provided a layout guide to replicate, we're free to customize it to reflect our own style or personality.

For this project, my goals were not only to make the page visually appealing but also to ensure it adapts well to different screen sizes. This gave me a great opportunity to practice Flexbox layouts and focus on writing clean, easy-to-understand code that I can reference later.
