# Odin-Landing-Page
This is my second project in The Odin Project: a responsive landing page built with HTML and CSS. Inspired by the provided layout, I customized the design to reflect my own style. My focus was on mastering Flexbox, creating a clean, adaptable layout, and keeping the code easy to follow for future reference.
