# Odin-Landing-Page

This is my second project for The Odin Project, titled Odin Landing Page. The task is to build a website using both HTML and CSS. While the course provided a layout guide to replicate, we're free to customize it to reflect our own style or personality.

For this project, I've noticed that the template resembles a SAAS type website, I asked chat-gpt to generate some weird yet fun themes. After generating some, I loved the idea of a "Dream logging" service. I think anyone can relate to this that we often forgot our dreams after we wake up, we don't remember them. This service could somehow provide a way to log them and give tools like journals, playback records, statistics and ai interpretations 

Apart from this, I want to make a website that can adapt to different screen sizes. This gave me a great opportunity to practice Flexbox layouts.
